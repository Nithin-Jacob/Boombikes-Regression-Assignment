# BoomBikes Demand Prediction
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 



## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is trying to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end.

A consulting company is approached to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. The company wants to know:

    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
    How well those variables describe the bike demands?

In this Assignment, we will use Multiple Linear Regression to build a model and understand how the demand varies with the features of dataset
- This project is a part of Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning of IIT Bangalore.

## Business Objective

* To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
* To understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The Temperature, year and Winter season are the three highest positively affecting Features.
- The Weather Light Rain or Snow and Windspeed are the highest negatively affecting Feature.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
